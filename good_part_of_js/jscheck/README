jscheck.js


JSCheck is a specification-driven testing tool. From a description of the
properties of a system, function, or object, it will generate random test
cases attempting to prove those properties, and then report its findings.
That can be especially effective in managing the evolution of a program
because it can show the conformance of new code to old code. It also provides
an interesting level of self-documentation, because the executable
specifications it relies on can provide a good view of the workings of a
program.
